Using the spotipy python library to access the Spotify API and explore features like create playlists, search for songs, and get audio features of songs etc. 

Setup your spotify developer account and create an app to get your client id and client secret. Store it in a .env file in the same directory as the python code.


```env
ID=69db......
SECRET=fd.......
REDIRECT_URI=https://localhost:8888/callback
```
